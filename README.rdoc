= Yahoo Weatherman

A simple wrapper for the Yahoo! Weather API.
 
It supports internationalization via YAML files. Just checkout the i18n directory to figure out how to
add support for your language. 

== Instalation

  gem install yahoo_weatherman

== Example

Weatherman is very easy to use. Just search for a city woeid in the Yahoo! Weather homepage and have fun!
url: http://weather.yahoo.com/search

  client = Weatherman::Client.new
  response = client.lookup_by_woeid 455821

  response.location['city'] # => "Belo Horizonte"
  response.location['country'] # => "Brazil"
  response.condition['date'] # => #<Date: -1/2,0,2299161>


  ptbr_client = Weatherman::Client.new :lang # => 'pt-br'
  response = ptbr_client.lookup_by_woeid 455821

  response.condition['text'] # => "Parcialmente Nublado"
  response.condition['country'] # => "Brasil"

If you don't know your WOEID, you can leverage Yahoo's [GeoPlanet](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet) API by providing your Yahoo App ID. Then you can search by postal code, city/state, landmark, or any other combination allowed by their service.  Such as:

    client = Weatherman::Client.new( { :app_id => '[YOUR YAHOO APP ID]' } )

    client.lookup_by_location('66061').condition['temp']
    client.lookup_by_location('olathe, ks').condition['temp']
    client.lookup_by_location('north pole').condition['temp']
    client.lookup_by_location('sydney opera house').condition['temp']
